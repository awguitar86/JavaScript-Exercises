// FUNCTIONS //

//REVERSE A STRING
/*Write a function called 'reverse' with one parameter (string)
The function should return that string after it's been reversed.
For example, if the passed in string is "this is my sentence", the function should return "ecnetnes ym si siht”*/
function reverse(){
  //...code here
}



// * Or you can do it this way *
// The split() method splits a String object into an array of string by separating the string into sub strings.
// The reverse() method reverses an array in place. The first array element becomes the last and the last becomes the first.
// The join() method joins all elements of an array into a string.
function reverse () {
  //...code here
}



// FOR LOOP INCREMENTING
/*•	Create a function called myLoop that takes in two parameters.
•	The first parameter should represent a starting number and the second is how many times the starting number should be incremented.
•	Use a for loop to increment the first parameter a number of times equal to the second parameter. Then return the modified number.
For example, if the first parameter is 3 and the second parameter is 4, the number three should be increased by one each time the
for loop runs, and the for loop should run 4 times. This should return the number 7*/
function myLoop (){
  //...code here
}



/*Create a function called exponent that takes in two parameters. The first parameter should represent a number to be
multiplied against itself and the second parameter should represent how many times it is multiplied by itself.
The function should return the result of this operation. */
function exponent() {
  //...code here
}



//Given a string, you have to return a string in which each character (case-sensitive) is repeated once.
function doubleChar() {
  //...code here
 }



/* REMOVE WHITE SPACE IN STRING */
//Simple, remove the spaces from the string, then return the resultant string.
function noSpace(){
  //...code here
}



/* CHANGE A NUMBER INTO A STRING */
function numberToString() {
  //...code here
}



/* REVERSE WORDS IN STRING BUT NOT WHOLE STRING */
//Write a reverseWords function that accepts a string as a parameter, and reverses each word in the string.
//Any spaces in the string should be retained.
function reverseWords() {
  //...code here
}



/* CHECK IF STRING IS AN ISOGRAM */
//An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive.
//Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram.
// Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.
function isIsogram(){
  //...code here
}



/* DOUBLE NUMBERS, AND REPEAT STRINGS */
// Write a function  called doubleTheFun that takes 1 parameter. It should double numbers, and
// repeats strings. example 4->8, 2.5->5, 'Awesome'->'AwesomeAwesome'
function doubleTheFun(){
	//...code here
}



/* Is this a triangle? */
//Implement a method that accepts 3 integer values a, b, c. The method should return true if a triangle
//can be built with the sides of given length and false in any other case.
//(In this case, all triangles must have surface greater than 0 to be accepted).
function isTriangle(){
  //...code here
}

/* Determine is square number */
// Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number
function isSquare(){
  //...code here
}



/* Dubstep */
//The input consists of a single non-empty string, consisting only of uppercase English letters, the string's length doesn't exceed 200 characters
//Return the words of the initial song that Polycarpus used to make a dubsteb remix. Separate the words with a space.
function songDecoder(){
  //...code here
}



/* DNA */
// Write a function that takes in the dna string, replace A with T, T with A, G with C, and C with G.
let dnaString = "ATTGC";
function DNAStrand(){
  //...code here
}



/* Checking Coupon Code */
//Write a function called checkCoupon to verify that a coupon is valid and not expired. If the coupon is good, return true. Otherwise, return false.
//A coupon expires at the END of the expiration date. All dates will be passed in as strings in this format: "June 15, 2014"
function checkCoupon(){
  //...code here
}

  

/* SUM OF TWO LOWEST POSITIVE INTEGERS */
// Create a function that returns the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array of minimum 4 integers. No floats or empty arrays will be passed.
// For example, when an array is passed like [19, 5, 42, 2, 77], the output should be 7.
function sumTwoSmallestNumbers() {
    //...code here
};



/* COUNT LOST SHEEP */
// Every week (Friday and Saturday night), the farmer and his son count amount of sheep returned to the yard of their farm.
// They count sheep on Friday night, the same goes for Saturday (suppose that sheep returned on Friday are not feeding back on hills on Saturday).
// As sheep are not coming in one flock, you will be given two arrays (one for each night) representing number of sheep as they were returning to the yard during the evenings (entries are positive ints, higher than zero).
// Farmer and his son know the total amount of their sheep, you will be given this number as third parameter.
// Your goal is to calculate the amount of sheep lost (not returned) to the farm after Saturday night counting.
// Example 1: Input: {1, 2}, {3, 4}, 15 --> Output: 5
// Example 2: Input: {3, 1, 2}, {4, 5}, 21 --> Output: 6
function lostSheep(){
  //...code here
}



/* REGEX VALIDATE PIN CODE */
// ATM machines allow 4 or 6 digit PIN codes and PIN codes cannot contain anything but exactly 4 digits or exactly 6 digits.
// If the function is passed a valid PIN string, return true, else return false.
function validatePIN(){
  //..code here
}
